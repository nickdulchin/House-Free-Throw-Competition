# House-Free-Throw-Competition
Analysis of mini-hoop free throw shooting data

My housemates and I have a mini basketball hoop and we have a contest where we take turns shooting 10 shots from a specified distance.
The winner is the person who makes the most out of 10 and in the event of a tie the winners shoot another 10 to determine who wins.
The competition was to see who would get the most wins by the end of the semester but the problem arose that some people played more
often or played in games with weaker competitors more often (official games have to have at least 3 people playing).

The goal of the simulation is to determine what would happen if all of the games were between all 6 of us.

I randomly sampled from each of our game sets (how many out of 10 we made in each game) 10,000 times to determine the proportion of wins
that each player would get.

Secondarily, I plotted the cumulative distribution of second best(not winning or tied for winning) scores to determine how often a given
score will give you a win(or tie).
